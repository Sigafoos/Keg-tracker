CBW needed a way to track kegs: what's where, what our current inventory is, etc. So I decided to write one.

It's based in PHP/MySQL, because that's what I know. (well, I could also use Oracle, but we don't have that kind of money).

It currently has no features and doesn't work. I just started it yesterday, give me a break. Eventually I see it being a JQTouch style webapp.
