Keg Tracker

Originally developed for Community Beer Works: http://www.communitybeerworks.com

CBW needed a way to track kegs: what's where, what our current inventory is, etc. So I decided to write one.

It's based in jQuery Mobile/PHP/MySQL, because that's what I know. (well, I could also use Oracle, but we don't have that kind of money).

UPDATES
12/3/12 I've been working along, just not updating the readme. It's fully functional, though missing some things like "add a new keg." Most recently I've added a config file to make setting up on another server easier.

10/5/12 It's actually kinda functional now! Still to do: add new beers/locations, password protect (probably .htpasswd), reports (kegs that are now clean/dirty, etc), log events (so you can see kegs that are old, kegs that have been at a bar for a long time, etc). I swear there was something else but I intended to go to bed 2.5 hours ago.

10/3/12 It's dumb to make the site then port it to JQTouch, so I'm doing that now. Eventually I'll detect non-mobile browsers and have a regular site too

9/24/2012 It currently has no features and doesn't work. I just started it yesterday, give me a break. Eventually I see it being a JQTouch style webapp.
